# Assignment_1

The purpose of this assigment is to present a pie chart that changes when we insert the data through a code made in html. For this we adapted a pie chart code of the javascript library d3.js. 

Also we have created a github repository that contains this explanation file and the html code. If we want to look to the html page we could go to https://rafaelab1227.github.io/Assignment_1/pie-chart.html

The final version has been tag as "Final commit"
